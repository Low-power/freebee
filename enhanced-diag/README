From email correspondence, it's clear a lot of people need (or at least want)
the new s4diag diagnostics disk software for use with either the WD2010 and/or
the P5.1 motherboard upgrade on the UNIXPC/7300/3B1.

Having not seen the software on any published list of archive sites, the
suggestion given me by several correspondents was to post it.  Since I don't
have mass disk-duplicating capability, the posting suggestion seems reasonable
to me, so here it is in two parts.

This posting comprises:

	README		This file

	Install		An install script to be executed on your UNIXPC system.
			Read the comments at the head of the file to see what
			it's doing and what you should do.  Look at the
			included sample output to see how it executes.

	s4diag		The uuencoded compressed s4diag program in 2 pieces.
			After unwrapping the shars, concatenate the 2 parts
			of s4diag and decode per:

			$ cat s4diag.Z.uue.1 s4diag.Z.uue.2 > s4diag.Z.uue
			$ uudecode s4diag.Z.uue
			$ uncompress s4diag

To provide a safety check against the vagaries of file transmission, be SURE
to check the checksums of the uudecoded s4diag program against those shown in
the following examples (the first example is that of the "stock" diag disk
which accompanied the 3.51 software release, the second example is that of
what you should have after executing the enclosed Install script):

"stock" 3.51 diagnostic disk:

	$ mount /dev/fp021 /mnt -r
	$ ls -l /mnt
	total 588
	-rwxr-xr-x  2 root    root     150186 Apr 20  1987 s4diag
	-rwxr-xr-x  2 root    root     150186 Apr 20  1987 unix
	$ sum /mnt/s4diag
	7490 147 /mnt/s4diag
	$ sum -r /mnt/s4diag
	54332   147 /mnt/s4diag
	$ umount /dev/fp021
	$ 

"new" diagnostic disk:

	$ mount /dev/fp021 /mnt -r
	$ ls -l /mnt
	total 588
	-r-xr-xr-x  2 root    root     150478 May 29 13:58 s4diag
	-r-xr-xr-x  2 root    root     150478 May 29 13:58 unix
	$ sum /mnt/s4diag
	64342 147 /mnt/s4diag
	$ sum -r /mnt/s4diag
	06158   147 /mnt/s4diag
	$ umount /dev/fp021
	$ 

A sample run of the Install script:

	$ sh Install
	You must 'su' because of the ch{own|grp|mod} at the end.
	Script aborted.
	$ su
	Password:
	# sh Install
	Insert a blank floppy disk and press the RETURN key: 
	Starting the floppy format.
	Ignore the 'It is safe to remove the floppy diskette.' message.
	slice 1
	bytes per logical block = 1024
	total logical blocks = 395
	total inodes = 96
	gap (physical blocks) = 2
	cylinder size (physical blocks) = 20 
	It is safe to remove the floppy diskette.
	Mounting floppy filesystem.
	Copying s4diag to floppy.
	Linking s4diag to unix.
	Checksums of s4diag on floppy:
	64342 147 /mnt/s4diag
	06158   147 /mnt/s4diag
	Setting owner, group and protections.
	Remove the floppy disk and affix a write-protect tab.

DISCLAIMER: the new s4diag works for me on all my 7300 and 3B1 systems.  I
do NOT know its genesis; I uucp'd my copy from Kevin O'Gorman since I was
in a hurry to test the WD2010 chip.  If the checksums of the s4diag program
on your system match the ones listed above, then everything should be fine.
But I CANNOT make any warranties or guarantees with regards to this software;
I have to say: "USE AT YOUR OWN RISK."  If you are uncomfortable with this
arrangement, then don't use the software.
